It may not seem like a big deal to you, but your typing skills may be placing you right out of a job.  Well, more specifically - your lack of typing skills, that is.  Maybe you use the "hunt and peck" method, or some variation of the ten fingers touch typing method.  Maybe you notice yourself looking at the keyboard often, searching for that one elusive key right under your pinky.  None of these, by the way, equate to marketable typing skills that might help you land a job.

You see, many of us may vaguely remember taking a typing course somewhere during our school days.  Maybe we used those skills on a few papers that semester and breezed through the rest of the class thinking, "when am I ever going to use this?"

The fact is this: that typing class you may have paid minimal attention to in school, could totally have landed you that job you just applied for.  Don't believe me?  Consider this; computers are a larger part of our lives now, than ever before.  Most jobs require at least the most basic computer skills, even jobs that 10 or 15 years ago did not.  In fact, many employers are requiring candidates to be able to type at least a minimum of 35 wpm just for the sake of productivity. 

There are a variety of reasons that employers are looking for people with above average typing skills.  More importantly though, are the benefits that honing these skills can give you.  It's not just about making yourself attractive to potential employers, learning a skill such as touch typing can help you get ahead in a number of ways.

More and more employers are looking at a candidate's typing skills as a prerequisite for the job, not as an optional skill.  Adding touch typing to your arsenal will put you ahead of the game and open a world of job opportunities to you.  Here is a list of just a few jobs out there that rely heavily on touch typing skills:
So, if you think that touch typing is a skill reserved for some secretary sitting behind a desk with a dusty typewriter, think again.  Touch typing is a skill that many of us can benefit from.   It not only makes you more marketable but, opens the door to more opportunities and helps to simplify our day to day activities.  
On average, it takes most people about a year of regular practice to efficiently work up to typing 60 wpm without error.
